I currently work as a part time Data Analyst in a construction technology company, where I conduct data analysis of project management and project finance data and build relevant dashboards in PowerBI.

I am looking to go further in Data Analytics and Data Science in the fintech industry, and for that I am currently upskilling my SQL skills with the help of practice tutorials from [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/). By August 2022, I am also looking to start the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) offered by Michigan University, and hope that by this upskilling endeavour, I will be able to transition to a full time Data Scientist role, where I am constantly in touch with data from the capital markets: Stocks, Real Estate, and Blockchain.
